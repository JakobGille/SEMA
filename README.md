# SEMA
Statistic Electroacoustic Music Analyzer

It extracts data from audio file into csv file.
Focuses on understanding the piece's formal structure and timbral evolution using Gemini.
Connects quantitative data to qualitative musical observations and concepts.
Defines the features and provide their meaning in an electroacoustic context:
- RMS Energy: Overall loudness/intensity.
- Spectral Centroid: Perceived brightness (higher value = brighter).
- Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR): Degree of noisiness vs. tonality (higher value = noisier/more percussive, lower = more tonal/sustained).
- Novelty Curve: Rate of significant sonic changes/onsets (peaks indicate 'newness' or activity).
- MFCCs: Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, a compact representation of timbral color/texture.
